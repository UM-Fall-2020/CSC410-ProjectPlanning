##### <u>Objective:</u>

In today's saturated mobile application marketplace, there are many applications that utilize databases to enhance app functionality. But, I have yet to see an application that utilizes a real-time database to represent a mobile digital encyclopedia on a variety of topics rather than a specific one such as an application that was made to find the details of a specific plant. What if there was a way to have encyclopedia categories stored onto a real-time database and with a button press, the one specific application on plants can now become one on household appliances or technology? This is the main objective that the KnowMixer App hopes to accomplish, contain multiple database "pages" on a variety of topics presented to the user in a fast and reliable fashion through a front-end application. 

##### <u>Solution Approach:</u>

The front-end application will be utilized
